Notes from Data Jam
-------------------

Planning
^^^^^^^^

Climate change -> flooding/uninhabitable land -> population displacement

- Social equity issues
- Impact on low income people/POC/historicall underserved

Questions
^^^^^^^^^

- Who is impacted?
- Where might people go?
- What land uses will be displaced?
- How do these concerns intersect with current gentrification in NOLA?
- Impact on water quality?
- Impact on other environmental justice/contamination issues?

Data sets and output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Flooding/land loss data and projections
- Contaminated land/brownfields
- Demographic data
- Data visualization and mapping

2018-03-15 Brainstorming Call Notes
-----------------------------------

What is the new stormwater capacity given recent changes? … measuring impact ...digging through individual case files (narrative text documents… could be a data scraping challenge?).  … could focus on a particular drainage basin.

How does decision-making around flooding interventions relate to gentrification / issues around social equity?

How stormwater fee can be rolled out in an equitable way? (both ability to pay and how it affects different communities). Incentivize measures in a way that makes sense (politically, etc.)

What areas of cities are at more risk of flooding? Exposing to more risk down the road?

Workshop to determine key questions (designing questions)... what are we not thinking about?

Flooding hotspots… are there unique characteristics that could be modeled? Pumping station data?

Crowd-sourcing data / public comments…

What data sets are available / recommended to address some of the questions above?

Possible data sets:

- FEMA fload maps
- Repetitive loss
- Trust for public land
- Historical 911 calls


Needs
^^^^^

- Guidance around the questions (don't want to figure this out the day of)
- Brainstorming specific challenges

Option 1 (Stormwater-themed)
----------------------------

**Overall question: What small scale stormwater projects (1 acre or less) would have the greatest impact on nuisance flooding from a precipitation event? What are some ideal sites for these projects? How can they be most responsive to community needs and desires?**

Considerations:

- What public space could be transformed to manage stormwater?
- What does current zoning allow for? Would changes need to be requested?
- Could a network of even smaller projects have the same impact?
- What level of participation would be needed from nearby private property owners?
- How can gentrification and displacement be mitigated in advance of implementation?
- Can the projects be designed to remediate brownfields or improve water quality?
- Could a drainage fee spur additional compliance from property owners? How would such a fee be calculated?

Option 2 (Housing)
------------------

**Overall question: With housing affordability continuing to erode, how can the city alter its short-term rental (STR) laws to prevent further displacement of long-term residents? Where can additional affordable housing be built? What other strategies need to be considered to plan for these units? How can we ensure that affordable housing isn’t built only in distant, unsafe, or contaminated locations, but is instead spread throughout New Orleans with strong transportation access?**

Considerations

- Where does current zoning allow for higher density?
- How are the current STR regulations altering how zoning is used to allow STRs in perpetuity? Does this impact other land uses?
- Which parcels could be developed for affordable housing?
- What policy tools are needed to ensure continued affordability?
- How do transportation networks (walk, bus, bike, transit, road) overlay with these potential parcels? What is the elevation? Are they brownfields?
- What have communities expressed that they need and want in these areas?
